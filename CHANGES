Since 0.2.13
  - a system to export and import Nostalgy's rules (through e-mails)
  - when showing a folder, if no message is currently selected,
    select the last one
  - change the behavior of the QuickSearch box: 
    * always show the popup menu to select/show the current search criterion
    * UP/DOWN: change the criterion (the view is automatically updated)
    * RETURN (customizable): start the search, select the last result, 
      focus thread pane
    * CTRL-RETURN (customizable): same, but select all results
    * ESCAPE: cancel search, focus thread pane

  - make Nostalgy work with TB 3.0 (tested with 3.0a1pre)
  - Thunderbirds shortcuts that are hidden by Nostalgy can now
    be used (type "Escape" before)

  - bug fix: custom shortcuts with no modifier are not recognized when typing
    in a text box (QuickSearch or Nostalgy's completion box)

0.2.12
  - bug fix: use the mime-decoded version for the subject (for matching
    rules and searching messages with same subject); needed to deal
    with accents in subjects

    and searching messages with same subject)

    server"

    or deleted from an imap folder

  - re-creates Eudora's Alt-Click: the "`" key (back quote) search for
    all messages from the same author as the current message (in the Sent 
    folder, search mail sent To: the same address as the first To: of the 
    current message)

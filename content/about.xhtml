   <h2>Usage directions for Nostalgy</h2>

   <p>
   Nostalgy adds several keyboard shortcuts to improve your
   productivity with Thunderbird. A custom preference dialog 
   for Nostalgy is available through the Tools menu.
   </p>

   <h3>Folder commands</h3>

   <p>The following shortcuts are available from the main Thunderbird's window.
   </p>

   <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Shortcut</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>G</td><td>Open a specific folder</td></tr>
    <tr><td>S</td><td>Move the current message to a specific folder</td></tr>
    <tr><td>C</td><td>Copy the current message to a specific folder</td></tr>
   </table>

   <p><b>Important:</b> even if the key shortcuts above are written in
uppercase, you don't need to press Shift.</p>

   <p>As a remainder and a sign of Nostalgy's presence, these shortcuts are 
      displayed in Thunderbird's status bar.</p>

   <p>The G, S and C commands open an auto-completion box 
      (in place of the status bar) 
      where you can select a folder by typing part of its name. 
      Regular 
      expressions are accepted as well (and .. is a short-hand for .*
      meaning: any sequence of characters). You can choose the first
      suggested completion with Return, or first choose another one with
      the Up/Down keys. You can cancel the command with Escape.
      The Tab key activates a shell-like autocompletion mode. In this mode,
      the completed suggestions only mentions possible completions
      one level down in the folder hierarchy, and the Tab key itself
      automatically completes with the longest unambiguous fragment.</p>

   <p>It is possible to restrict (see the preference dialog)
   the completion to the folders on the
   same server as the currently displayed folder.</p>

   <p>The S and C commands also work in a standalone message window.</p>

   <p>The G command also focuses the thread pane.</p>

   <h3>3-pane navigation</h3>

   <p>
   Because of the G command,
   the folder pane becomes thus much less useful, and it can be
   hidden with the L shortcut.
   </p>

   <p>
   Nostalgy also allows to scroll the message while the thread pane
   is focused with the Ctrl-Left/Right keys. Because of that,
   it is a good idea to leave the thread pane always focused.
   Nostalgy still provides shortcuts to easily focus one of the three
   panes.
   </p>

   <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Shortcut</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>L</td><td>Hide/show the folder pane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-F</td><td>Focus the folder pane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-M</td><td>Focus the message pane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-Esc</td><td>Focus the thread pane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-Esc-Esc</td><td>Focus the thread pane, clear quick search box</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-I</td><td>Focus the quick search box</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ctrl-Left/Right</td>
         <td>Scroll the message from the thread pane</td></tr>
   </table>

   <p>The Esc-X shortcuts means: press and release Escape, and then
   press X within 300ms (Esc-Esc is thus like a double click on Escape).</p>

   <p>
   When the thread pane is focused, you can scroll the currently
   displayed message (up and down) by pressing Ctrl-Left/Ctrl-Right.
   </p>

   <h3>Rules</h3>

   <p>Nostalgy has a notion of rule. A rule associates a folder to a
   message by looking for a substring of the From or To/Cc, or Subject 
   headers (or a combination of them). 
   A rule can be restricted to match messages only under
   a given server/folder. When a rule selects a folder for a given message,
    Nostalgy
   informs you in the status line.  You can then use the Shift-S/Shift-C
   shortcuts to move/copy directly the message to this folder.  
   Nostalgy's rules can be edited from the preference dialog.</p>

   <p>
   When no rule apply to a given message, Nostalgy proposes to re-use
   (with Shift-S/Shift-C) the folder same as for the last move/copy 
   operation folder. If the folder lookup has been restricted
   to the current server (in the Nostalgy preference dialog), then
   the last operation folder is attached to the current server. Otherwise,
   it is global.
   </p>

   <h3>In the Composer</h3>

   <p>Nostalgy adds some support for keyboard operations to the Composer window.</p>

   <p>When typing in a header, it's possible to change easily the header
to either "To:" or "Cc:". To do so, you need to be at the beginning
of the input box, and simply type "to " or "cc " (with the whitespace,
without the quotes).</p>

   <p>The Esc-Esc combination focuses the message body. The Esc-A combination
opens the file attachment dialog.</p>

   <h3>Preferences</h3>
   
   <p>The preference dialog for Nostalgy is the place where rules are
   defined. In addition, five switches control the way the completion
   box (where folder names are proposed) is populated.</p>

   <p>The first switch restricts the lookup to folders on the same
   server/account as the currently active folder. In this mode,
   the server name is not displayed (and must not be typed) in
   the input line and the completion box.</p>

   <p>The second switch forces Nostalgy to interpret differently what
      is typed in the text. Normally, when the option is disabled, 
      it is interpreted as a regexp which can match an arbitrary substring
      of the complete folder name (including the account name and 
      the name of parent folders). When the option is enabled,
      the regexp must match either a substring of the local folder name
      (not the full name) or a prefix of the full folder name.</p>

   <p>The third switch sorts folder in the completion box in alphabetical
   order.</p>
  
   <p>The fourth switch controls whether folder names are matched
   in a case sensitive or insensitive way.</p>

   <p>The fifth switch controls whether the Tab key triggers shell-like
      completion. If it is unchecked, Tab simply cycles through suggestions,
      like the down arrow key.</p>

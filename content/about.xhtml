   <h2>Nostalgy</h2>

   <p>
   Nostalgy adds several keyboard shortcuts to improve your
   productivity with Thunderbird. A custom preference dialog 
   for Nostalgy is available through the Tools menu.
   </p>

   <h3>Folder commands</h3>

   <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Shortcut</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>G</td><td>Open a specific folder</td></tr>
    <tr><td>S</td><td>Move the current message to a specific folder</td></tr>
    <tr><td>C</td><td>Copy the current message to a specific folder</td></tr>
   </table>

   <p>As a remainder and a sign of Nostalgy's presence, these shortcuts are 
      displayed in Thunderbird's status bar.</p>

   <p>The G, S and C commands open an auto-completion box 
      (in place of the status bar) 
      where you can select a folder by typing part of its name. 
      Matching is case-insensitive. Regular 
      expressions are accepted as well (and .. is a short-hand for .*
      meaning: any sequence of characters). You can choose the first
      suggested completion with Return, or first choose another one with
      the Up/Down keys. You can cancel the command with Escape.</p>

   <p>It is possible to restrict (see the preference dialog)
   the completion to the folders on the
   same server as the currently displayed folder.</p>

   <p>The S and C commands also work in a standalone message window.</p>

   <h3>3-pane navigation</h3>

   <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Shortcut</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>L</td><td>Hide/show the folder pane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-F</td><td>Focus the folder pane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-M</td><td>Focus the message pane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Esc-Esc</td><td>Focus the thread pane</td></tr>
   </table>

   <p>The Esc-X shortcuts means: press and release Escape, and then
   press X within 300ms (Esc-Esc is thus like a double click on Escape).</p>

   <p>
   When the thread pane is focused, you can scroll the currently
   displayed message (up and down) by pressing Shift-Left/Shift-Right.
   </p>

   <p>
   The rationale behind the L command is that thanks to Nostalgy's folder
   commands, you rarely need the folder pane.
   </p>

   <h3>Rules</h3>

   <p>Nostalgy has a notion of rule. A rule associates a folder to a
   message by looking for a substring of the Sender or Subject (or both)
   headers. A rule can be restricted to match messages only under
   a given server/folder. When a rule selects a folder for a given message,
    Nostalgy
   informs you in the status line.  You can then use the Shift-S/Shift-C
   shortcuts to move/copy directly the message to this folder.  
   Nostalgy's rules can be edited from the preference dialog.</p>

   <p>
   When no rule apply to a given message, Nostalgy proposes to re-use
   (with Shift-S/Shift-C) the folder same as for the last move/copy 
   operation folder. If the folder lookup has been restricted
   to the current server (in the Nostalgy preference dialog), then
   the last operation folder is attached to the current server. Otherwise,
   it is global.

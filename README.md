Adds keyboard shortcuts to change folder, move/copy messages, with
folder name auto-completion (using only the keyboard).  Also includes a
system of rules to suggest a target folder for saving messages;
re-creates Eudora's Alt-Click; facilitates navigation in the 3-pane
window; makes it easy to change between To/Bcc/Cc fields in the
composer. All that with the keyboard only!

Other keyboard actions include: changing focus between panes, scroll
the message while keeping the focus on the thread pane, changing
header in the composer (To/Cc/Bcc), adding an attachment, hide the
folder view.

Save time and get back the productivity you were used to with
mutt/pine/eudora!
